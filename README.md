The files in the repository were created for testing purposes. They are free to use how ever you'd like. The files are located in two folders:

The tracks in the Silence folder are all 2 minutes long and contain nothing but silence.

The tracks in the Tone folder are all 1 minute long and contain a continuous tone sound.

The naming convention for the tracks/files is as follows:
channels - bit depth - bit rate . file format

-Channels can be: mono, stereo or 5.1 (surround sound)
-Bit depth can be: 8 bit, 16 bit, 24 bit or 32 bit
-Bit rate can be: 44.1 kbps, 48 kbps, 96 kbps or 192 kbps
-File format - all files are WAV files

With this in mind, here's an example filename:
stereo-16-44.1.wav
