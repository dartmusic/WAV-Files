The wav files in this repository were created for testing purposes. They are free to use how ever you'd like. The files are located in the Tracks folder. They are all 2 minutes long and contain nothing but silence.

The naming convention for the tracks/files is as follows:
channels - bit depth - bit rate . file format

-Channels can be: mono or stereo
-Bit depth can be: 16 bit, 24 bit or 32 bit
-Bit rate can be: 44.1 kbps, 48 kbps or 96 kbps
-File format - all files are WAV files

With this in mind, here's an example filename:
stereo-16-44.1.wav
